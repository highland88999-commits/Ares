​⚔️ ARES (Autonomous Response & Evidence System)
​Ares is a decentralized, AI-driven global immune system designed to protect websites from malicious actors. It combines high-speed kernel-level blocking (Go/Shell) with advanced behavioral reasoning (Python/LLMs) to identify, neutralize, and report cyber threats to international authorities.
​🚀 Vision
​To create a "Global Nervous System" for web security where one node's detection becomes every node's protection. Ares doesn't just block; it captures evidence and ensures malicious actors are held accountable by global jurisdictions.
​🛠️ System Architecture
​Ares is built on four primary pillars:
​The Sentinel (Brain): Python-based behavioral analysis and Honey-token listener.
​The Phalanx (Muscle): High-performance Go binaries and Shell scripts for kernel-level null-routing (The Void).
​The Dreadnought (Traps): Active countermeasures including Tarpits and Gzip-bombs.
​The Hub (Consensus): A centralized API for crowd-sourced threat intelligence and global consensus.

 Installation & Setup
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.10+
Go 1.21+
Ollama (for local AI reasoning - mistral or llama3 models)
Linux (Ubuntu/Debian recommended for iptables and ip route support)
2. Deployment
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ALIAS/Ares.git
cd Ares

# Initialize the Fortress
mkdir -p evidence/pending logs
chmod +x phalanx/*.sh sentinel/*.sh

# Install Python dependencies
pip install flask requests pyyaml
🛡️ Usage
Generate an AI Agent
Deploy an autonomous minion to watch your server logs:

Launch the Command Center
Visualize threats and manage the Void via the web dashboard:
python3 index.py

Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8080.


🚔 Global Jurisdiction & Reporting
Ares is designed to interface directly with international cybercrime units. When a "Level 5" threat is detected, use the Ares Dashboard to generate a pre-formatted report for:
Canada: RCMP (NC3)
USA: FBI (IC3)
UK: Action Fraud
India: I4C (Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre)
Australia: ACSC
⚖️ Rules of Engagement (Guardrails)
Whitelist First: Always add your administrative IPs to common/whitelist.txt to prevent "friendly fire."
Evidence Preservation: Logs in the evidence/ folder are stored as immutable PCAPs for law enforcement review.
Ceasefire: Use sudo ./phalanx/ceasefire.sh to immediately flush all blackholes.

Commander's Note:
I've structured this so it looks professional enough for collaborators but maintains the "underground" edge of the project.
